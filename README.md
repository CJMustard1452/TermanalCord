# TerminalCord

TerminalCord is a powerful Discord bot that allows users to execute code snippets directly from their console. With TerminalCord, you can quickly test and run code without the need for any external tools or IDEs.

## Installation

To use TerminalCord, you will need a Discord bot token and Discord.js version 14. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CJMustard1452/TerminalCord
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the project from the [Releases](https://github.com/CJMustard1452/TerminalCord/releases) tab.

2. (IF YOU ARE USING SOURCE CODE) Install the dependencies using npm:

## Usage
When TerminalCord is activated it will ask for a discord bot token, copy and paste it from the [Discord Developers Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

TermanalCord REQUIRES your bot to have privileged intents enabled.
